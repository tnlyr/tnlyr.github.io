# TestMyRScore
## Inspiration
Every year Quebec students finish their CEGEP degrees with no particular University studies in mind. Additionally many CEGEP students struggle to understand and gauge their RScores and the effect that their RScore has on their academic future. TestMyRScore was built to help CEGEP students with these problems.
## What it does
TestMyRScore provides students with an RScore Calculator as well as a University Requirements Calculator. The RScore Calculator can be used by students to give themselves a rough estimate of their RScore based on their current grades. Additionally, the University Requirements Calculator provides students with a list of all programs, from select Universities (currently Concordia and McGill), in which they meet the minimum requirements of admission based on the previous academic year.
## How it's built
The majority of the application is written in JavaScript, using several frameworks such as React and TypeScript. The breakdown of technologies:
#### Front End:
The following Front End technologies are being utilized:
* React
* MaterialUI
* CSS
* HTML
#### Back End (Temp):
There is currently no dedicated Back End. It is not necessary at this point in time, although there are possibilities of building one using ExpressJS, NodeJS, Mongoose and MongoDB in the future.
